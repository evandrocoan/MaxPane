## MaxPane

Easily maximize/unmaximize a pane without reseting your multi-pane setup.

Ever use a multi pane setup in Sublime Text and want to maximize a single pane for a bit, *and* be able to switch back to the multi pane layout again when done? *Without losing the positions all your files were in.* You know like how iTerm does.

*Then MaxPane is for you.*

So lets say you have this multi pane setup:

![dual pane](https://raw.github.com/jisaacks/MaxPane/ba0b8850c2637709428db88b072d6ca79f54543c/dual-thumb.png)

and you want to maximize the right pane for a sec.

Just press <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> and the active pane is now maximized:

Press <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> another time and its back:

### Installation

This is a new project, so the only installation method is via `git clone`. I will be adding to [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) when I believe it is ready for prime time.
